`use_cache=True` is incompatible with gradient checkpointing. Setting `use_cache=False`.
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/generation/utils.py:2134: UserWarning: You are calling .generate() with the `input_ids` being on a device type different than your model's device. `input_ids` is on cpu, whereas the model is on cuda. You may experience unexpected behaviors or slower generation. Please make sure that you have put `input_ids` to the correct device by calling for example input_ids = input_ids.to('cuda') before running `.generate()`.
